                    <h2>School District No. 92 (Nisga'a)</h2>
                </div>
                <p class="lead">The Nisga’a School District is situated in the Nass Valley and students are primarily of Nisga’a descent. Our district is unique in that it’s small and students are members of one language and cultural group – the Nisga’a Nation. From the Nass Valley it is an easy drive to a ski hill, numerous hotsprings, many world-class fishing spots and Terrace, a regional centre that includes many amenities. For more information about the Nisga’a Nation and the Nass Valley visit the <a href="http://www.nisgaanation.ca/">Nisga’a Lisims Government website</a>.</p>
